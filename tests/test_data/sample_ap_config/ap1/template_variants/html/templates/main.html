    <p>This report is automatically generated from the RDF data and aims at presenting the difference between
        two versions of an authority table maintained in VocBench3 following VB3-SRC-AP application profile.</p>
    <p>The report is primarily focused on the concept instances (skos:Concept), and does not cover other classes as they
        may occur (e.g. skos:ConceptScheme, skosxl:Label, euvoc:XlNote etc.).</p>
    <p>This is a beta version of the report and is subject to changes.</p>
